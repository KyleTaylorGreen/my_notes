# Notes on Git:

### Some Git commmands I've learned:

```
git status

The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. 
It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. 
Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.


git clone

git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.


git add

The git add is a command, which adds changes in the working directory to the staging area. With the help of this command, you tell Git that you want to add updates to a certain file in the next commit.


git diff

Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc


git commit

A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). 
It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to
keep record of what changes were made when and by who. 
Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.


git push

The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. 
Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.


git log

Git log is a utility tool to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository.
